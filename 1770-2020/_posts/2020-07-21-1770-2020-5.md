20 July 2020 - Town of 1770
COVID-19 certainly punched a great big hole in our travel plans for this year.  If not for the pandemic, we would now be swanning around somewhere in Europe (we didn’t have a detailed plan – just tickets).  I am not complaining though, there are a LOT of people far worse off than us, and I hope for everybody’s sake that this is all over sooner rather than later.

While I managed a trip to Phillip Island in late February ( what was I thinking....), Judith has not been away for ages, so with things seemingly under control in Queensland, we decided to spend a couple of days at Town of Seventeen Seventy.  Being retired allows us the luxury of having a long weekend in the middle of the week, which is why we booked an AirBnb from Tuesday (to allow for Judith’s Monday French class) to Friday.

A couple of days before we were due to leave, our host (another Judith – I am told they are all exceptional people) said we could also have Monday at no extra cost – how good is that?

We packed up the car and left home after Judith got back from her lesson.  I swear, the amount of stuff we jammed into the car, you would think we were going to be away for a month!

Some 2 hours into a 4.5 hour drive, Judith asked why we had chosen to go so far from home, when for he past 4 months we had not ventured past the front gate unless absolutely necessary.  My answer – that it made the trip seem like more of an adventure, was met with a quizzical glance that hinted at a deeper scepticism.  Of course, I was proven right.  Earlier I had ignored GPS directions that would have seen us on the quickest route and now I gladly followed instructions that took us down a gravel road, through a National Park – it was a little bit exciting because by gotten dark by this time.  There were no dramas though – the only scare, a wallaby darting across the road, but she made it safely.

We arrived at our AirBnB and found the designated driveway (a bit harder in the dark than it would have been during the day) and were soon settled in with snacks and a VERY nice red wine.

The place we are staying is described as a “Beach Shack” – it is not luxurious, but it is homey, comfortable and has everything we need.
