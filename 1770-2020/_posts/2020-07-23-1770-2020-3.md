22 July 2020 – Town of Seventeen Seventy
The weather is not going to be kind to us on this trip – this morning was overcast, grey and threatening rain, but that did not stop us having a walk along the foreshore, and down to the marina – where we found a coffee shop open and so we just had to stop and assist the local economy.  The staff were on “Island Time” (that is my problem to deal with – not theirs), but the coffee was not too bad.  

We then headed back home to have a rest after the hectic morning activities. 

Lunch today was to be the pub at 1770.  Judith quickly dismissed the idea of walking down, and of course she was right – it started to drizzle as we drove off.  I didn’t think the meals were as good as yesterday, but the views out over the ocean more than made up for that. 

The afternoon was spent reading and generally lounging around as the weather was not conducive to being outside.

The day concluded with wine, cheese and a couple of movies.
