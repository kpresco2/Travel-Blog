23 July 2020 – Town of 1770
I have been surprised by the number of tourists about – the camp ground is full and several motels have no vacancy signs out.  I guess there are lots of people like us that just want a change of scenery.

It was again wet and miserable this morning, but we did attempt a walk.  We didn’t get far, and ended up scurrying back to the cafe to enjoy a hot drink.  We are certainly getting plenty of rest on this trip!

Lunch today was at the lovely Gateway Garden Cafe.  The service and food were both good and the staff friendly and the outlook on a nice day would be fantastic – it wasn’t too bad today despite the weather.  

After lunch we visited the nearby 1770 Distillery.  Here we tried two fruit liqueurs, neither of which really grabbed our attention enough to part with $45 for a bottle.   The owner said he had been extra busy in the morning and had sold out of the other two liqueurs he normally has for tasting – maybe we just missed out on the best ones?  He mentioned that business was brisk at the moment and there were more tourists around than would have been normally at this time of year. 

One of the reasons we chose this Airbnb was the promise of a view of stunning sunsets across the water – pretty rare in Queensland.  With the weather as it has been, we have not seen any sign of the sun – let alone sunsets – but tonight the clouds parted at just the right time and we were able to catch a glimpse of what had been promised – pretty spectacular.

Well it is wine, cheese, chocolate and movies to finish of another day for us.
