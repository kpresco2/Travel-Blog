21 July 2020 - Town of Seventeen Seventy
We had no plans for our stay here, it is just a chance to get away from the chores that constantly demand our attention (but rarely get it). Judith, however has managed to bring her French homework and is spending time head down and bum up, while I drink coffee and admire the trees surrounding us – not a lot different to home (just minus the nagging chores).

We have decided to stick to our daily eating routine – A light breakfast (toast or cereal), our main meal at lunch time and snacks for dinner (olives, salami, cheese, and other delicious titbits).

Where we have departed from normality is that we are eating out for lunch rather than cooking our own. Today we found ourselves at the Agnes Water Tavern where I had a very nice steak and Judith had chicken, together with a couple of drinks made for a very pleasant lunch. I asked the publican how business was going – he said it had been pretty good since re-opening and he was happy that the crowd was now mainly centred on the restaurant – with very few people coming in to drink themselves to oblivion.

After lunch we drove back to 1770 and stopped along the foreshore for a bit – unfortunately the tide was out and the weather has turned a bit windy and miserable, but not too cold, so the stroll on the beach was pleasant enough.

Next we drove up to Bustard Bay Lookout and had a another stroll there as well.  This time the wind made things a tad unpleasant but the views were certainly worth it.

Once back in our comfy little nest we sat down with a cup of tea and did a bit of reading.  This was never going to be an energetic trip!

We spent the evening watching a DVD and having a couple of wines with cheese and crackers, a very relaxed way to end the day.
