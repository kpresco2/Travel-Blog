16 October 2018 - Bangalow
We are travelling again, this time to exotic places like Brisbane, Bangalow and a heap of other places that don't start with B.

We left home yesterday, with the first blue sky we have seen in a week showing through.  We drove to Brisbane and of course on the way ran into a whole lot more rain.  We were in Brisbane to visit our friend Cathy, and pick up a bag of things we left with her when we departed for Europe earlier this year.  Unsurprisingly we spent the afternoon regaling her with tales of our recent adventures.

For dinner we all went to Marinara Trattoria, a very cute Italian restaurant in Paddington that has excellent food.

We set off about 10am this morning from Cathy's place in Bardon, but only made it as far as Rainworth, where we stopped at Rainworth General for a VERY nice coffee.

Now we finally did get on the road heading south.  Our Airbnb had a check-in time of 2pm, and I thought we would be very early, however I didn't factor in Daylight Saving, so by the time we got to Bangalow and found some lunch (it was so good to be able to have a simple meat pie), it was time to check-in.

What a great place Judith found and our hosts Rosie and John are lovely people.   After settling in we drove back into town for a bit more of a look around.  We could easily have walked, but the black clouds heading our way convinced us that the car was a better option this time, and it proved to be a wise choice, with the heavens opening while we strolled along the main street.

Bangalow is a cute little town (popularion around 2000), in the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales, located close to the popular holiday spot of Byron Bay.   The town has plenty of trendy shops and eateries, and I am sure would be jam packed with tourists during the holiday period, but at the moment seems pretty laid back.

We tried out the pub for dinner and we were suitably impressed, the food was abundant and very good, and not your usual pub grub.
