03 November 2018 - Canberra
Melbourne turned out some weird weather to send us on our way on Friday, very windy and rain.  We had a stop at Holbrook for lunch, and took the opportunity to get a photo of HMAS Ottway, a submarine,  located in a local park.  Arriving in Canberra, the weather was similar to Melbourne, with the addition of a Total Fire Ban - not good!

Saturday saw us being tourists.  First up a visit to the National Museum of Australia to see the exhibit 'Rome City + Empire', which featured items from the British Museum.  We spent a good couple of hours here and both really enjoyed it.  The audio guide was great as it added "life" to  select pieces.  

Next we went for a drive up Black Mountain to have a look at the Telecom tower.  A lift soon had us at the indoor viewing area, with great views of Canberra.  It is very evident how dry it is, especially seeing the smoke from bushfires already burning.  A few steps led us up to the outdoor platform - we didn't stay long as the wind was horrendous.  

We had dinner with Ian and Moyan, friends we had not seen for 30+ years.  It was great to catch up with what they have been doing over that time.
