19 October 2019 - Sydney.
We have spent a couple of days visiting our nephew Andy, his wife Kerrie and two boys William and Toby.  It was really good to catch up with the whole family, and finally meet little Toby.  

Andy and Kerrie have moved to a 25 acre property near Wauchope which has outstanding views, but is going to keep them busy in the next few years as they implement their plans.

We arrived in Sydney early this afternoon and will spend the next few days visiting Judith's sister Roslyn and her husband Garry.  We have been chatting since we arrived, with a visit from Judith's brother Mitch adding to the session.  Boy those Andersons can talk, and from past experience that will be the pattern until we leave on Tuesday.....
