23 October 2018 - Cann River.
We have had a couple of relaxing days in Sydney.  On Saturday Ros took us to the local Oatley Festival where we wandered around the market stalls, had a coffee, and then saw a quilt show with some very impressive work on display.

Later in the afternoon a big storm hit Sydney, but luckily all we got was some pretty heavy rain and an exciting light and sound show.   With our car parked on the street,  I had been a bit nervous about hail but that was a non issue.

For dinner we all went to a local Chinese restaurant.  Garry & Ros have been going for over 30 years and know the staff pretty well.  The food was really good and we had a great night.

Sunday saw us navigating the Sydney public transport system which felt a bit like being back in a foreign city.  After getting off the train at Martin Place, we walked to the Art Gallery of New South Wales but to get there we had to cross the road where a wheelchair race for the Invictus Games was taking place, it was great to see the support these athletes were getting.  

We went to the "Modern Masters of the Hermitage" exhibit at the Gallery.  The exhibit was interesting with works by some well known artists, as well as lesser known artists (and completely unknown by me) on display.  

We had lunch at a cafe in the Botanical Gardens, fish & chips sitting at an outdoor table.  Judith had a piece of fish stolen out of her hand by a kookaburra whose flaping wing gave me a smack in the eye as he swooped past.  

We managed to survive the chaos that is a Morton Clan Sunday night dinner.  Lots of kids , noise and laughter,  it was a really good night and a rare chance for us to catch up with everyone.

Monday saw us pretty much veg out, with nothing much happening except a walk to Penshurst for coffee and lots of chatting.

We headed south this morning  after a great visit,  thanks Ros & Garry for putting us up, and putting up with us.

The trip through Sydney was incredibly easy for peak hour, but we were heading out of Sydney rather than into the city, so it wasn't all that surprising.  We stopped for a coffee and pie at Goulburn and again for petrol near Canberra.  The rest of the trip to Cann River was a breeze.  Now we have plenty of time to relax.
