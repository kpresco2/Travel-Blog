12 November 2018 - Verrierdale
Home again finally, after spending the last few days of our trip camping.

Friday we visited the Tweed Regional art gallery, which houses the Margaret Ollie art centre.  The centre has recreations of some rooms from Margaret's home/ studio in Sydney as it was at the time of her death.  It is amazing to see the detail in the recreation which uses many,many items from the house.  The gallery itself is very nice, and has well laid out displays.  The cafe is not bad either.

Saturday we drove to Uki for a coffee and had a bit of a look around this quiet little town.  We also took a quick trip into Murwillumbah to pick up a few things, and ended up having lunch at the Services Club - very nice.

Sunday we took another trip into Murwillumbah for coffee, and on the way back we stopped at the National Park and had a walk, no not the 9klm climb to the top of Mt Warning, just a short stroll through the beautiful rainforest.  We again went to the art gallery cafe for lunch, then attended a talk by Deirdre Bean whose exhibition of Botanical paintings of mangroves is currently on display.  The talk was very interesting, with scientific input from Dr Norman Duke.  It was a great afternoon.  We arrived back at the campground to find (to our great relief) that the group of screaming school kids who turned up Saturday morning had left, the great afternoon got even better.

This morning we packed the tent, then drove into town for breakfast, before heading home.  So the car is unpacked, the camping gear stowed away and the washing almost done.  Now where to next.....
