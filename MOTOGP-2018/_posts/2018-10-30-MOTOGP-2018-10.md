30 October 2018 - Rosebud
Wow, another amazing Phillip Island experience!!

The weather was as unpredictable as ever, ranging from beautiful blue skies to rain (often within a few minutes of each other), the only real constant being the wind, but even that changed direction a few times.

The racing was fantastic in all three international  classes,  and the local support categories also turned on some spectacular action.  I was happy not to have too many crashes at my point ( none on Sunday, so I got to watch the racing which does not always happen).  The highlight of the weekend for me was driving in the Riders' Parade and getting to listen as Bradley Smith and Pol Espagaro discussed their respective bikes'  performance at each of the corners.

Monday we moved camp from Phillip Island to Rosebud, where we pitched the tent in one of the council foreshore camping grounds.  It is a nice spot, but a bit noisy with the Nepean Highway close by.

We were in Rosebud to catch up with my nephew Clinton, his wife Rachel and their two lovely (but shy) kids.  We all enjoyed a great meal at the Sorrento hotel which finished off a great night.
