08 November 2018 - Murwillumbah
We left Canberra Sunday morning and had an easy drive to Hilltop to visit Judith's brother Mitchell, thankfully arriving in time to watch Motogp and see Jorge Martin win the MOTO3 World Championship.

We spent a great few days with Mitch, chatting (he is an Anderson after all), eating, drinking, going for walks and occasional forays to Mittagong for coffee (the Station Coffee House is really good).  Mitch kept us well fed, but we did drag him to the Mittagong RSL for a very nice meal one night.  Thanks Mitch for looking after us so well.  It was good to catch up with you.

Thursday morning we were on the road early as we had a lot of miles to cover.  I thought getting through Sydney would be a problem, but I think Newcastle was just as bad.  We also encountered a LOT of road works that also slowed us up a bit.   We arrived in Murwillumbah and started looking for a camp ground, the first one Judith didn't like, and the second one didn't thrill me, so we ended up at the Mt Warning Forest Park, about 15 klms out of town, now neither of us is happy (only joking, it seems a reasonable place to spend a bit of quiet time, and we are both comfortable with being here).
