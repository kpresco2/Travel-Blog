13 Apr 2021 - Guyra 

I'm off to another race meeting, this time to Wakefield Park in NSW for a round of the Australian Superbikes.  

I got away about 7am this morning in fine but cool conditions.  The trip was relatively uneventful, except that Commissioners Flat road was closed at the far end, still the detour was actually a nice ride, despite some of it being on a gravel road. 

Breakfast was a coffee and a pie at Esk, and I was supposed to have lunch when I stopped at Warwick for petrol.  That didn't happen.  I thought I would stop for a break at Glen Innes, but that was before I struck the dreaded roadworks (the bridge being built at Bolivar Hill looks like it will be pretty spectacular).  I swear I was delayed for over 30 minutes all told - it did seem like more...  Anyway I stopped often enough that there was not need to stop at Glen Innes.  

Once I got to Guyra, I filled up with petrol and then headed for the Royal Hotel where I had booked a room.  It didn't take long to park the bike in the pub courtyard, get my stuff in the room, and find a seat at the bar.  I really enjoyed that beer. 

After a call to home command, a few chores and a wash, it was time for dinner. 

It didn't take long to decide what to have, there was pepperoni pizza on the menu, and it wasn't too bad, the only downside was - no Peroni to wash it down.  I had to make do with Toohey' Old.... 

Early night tonight I think.
