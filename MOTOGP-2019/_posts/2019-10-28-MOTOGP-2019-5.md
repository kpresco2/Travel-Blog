24-28 October 2019
I had a good night’s sleep as the campervan is very comfortable.  Getting up early meant I could do a few chores before driving into Cowes to have a coffee, do some shopping and check out the event merchandise (I didn’t buy any...).

I had arranged to meet my friend Kevin in town for lunch.  We had the best pizzas at Pino’s Trattoria, but didn’t get to see any rider while we were there, apparently it is popular with the Italians.

Once back at the camp, I set off to the muster shed to pick up my overalls and find out where I would be for the weekend – turn 9 right – I have not been on that point before, so I was looking forward to seeing what it is like.  I caught up with a few other friends at the shed, before walking back to the camp.  Dam that is a long walk.

I got myself sorted out for the weekend, then sat with Kevin and Paul having a chat and a few beers.  We eventually decided that some food would be good, but none of us felt like walking to the visitors’ centre cafe, so it was off up to the Highside campground for a hamburger, dim sims and a very expensive beer.  

The weather was perfect all day, if anything a little too hot, but the breeze had cooled the day off nicely by 9:30pm when I got to bed.

Friday started out OK, but that did not last too long, with showers and a cold wind making life a bit uncomfortable.  I was on point with five other blokes, with half the team being newbies.  I have never seen so many marshals.  For the whole day we only had one bike come to us, and he rode through the gravel trap and bounced into the air fence, but didn’t fall off.  I let the other guys handle it and just supervised from where I could see the big screen....

As usual we ended the day back at the muster shed with a few beers and some bar snacks.  The Moto3 wildcard riders came over for a chat and signed some autographs.  We also got to hear from Fast Freddie Spencer.  Freddie won the 500cc World Championship in 1983 and again in 1985, but in 1985 he also won the 250 Championship, the last rider to win championships in two classes in the same year.  Freddie talked about racing at Phillip Island and also mentioned he tested at Surfers Paradise, a circuit I remember fondly – in spite of crashing there.

We caught the bus back to the camp ground, all three of us (Kevin, Paul and I) deciding to have an early night.  I think Paul said it best 
“We are getting old”
How true is that.

Saturday was cold.  Overnight rain and wind had damaged some tents in the campground, and I was reliably informed that some marshals had packed up and gone home, but none that I know.  

I was moved to another point in the same sector which didn’t have a big screen, but did have a great view of turn 7 and 8 (probably my favourite part of the track) and there was no need to jump off a tyre wall in case of a crash.  There wasn’t any crashes at turn 9 so I did nothing all day again.

My nephew Clinton dropped by my point and we had a bit of a chat between sessions and I asked him to come the officials’ BBQ that night.

The weather was windy and cold and alternated between showers and sun – a typical Phillip Island day, however the wind got so bad that MotoGP qualifying was postponed until Sunday morning.  That meant we got an early mark, and I was able to visit the Expo tent for the first time in many years, not that I particularly wanted to buy anything, I just wanted to have a look – but maybe that Tenere 700 would be a good addition to my garage – no I don’t think that is going to happen.

The BBQ was good, Wayne Gardner came over and spoke for a while, and I was able to catch up with Clinton again and had one or two beers too many as is usual on Saturday, but we still managed to catch the last bus back to the camp ground.

There was more destruction, some tents and shelters flattened or in tatters.  Kevin’s tent was a mangled mess, which he packed up but was able to sleep in the back of his car OK.  My van remained cosy!

Sunday was again cold, and there had been rain overnight, but it had stopped by the time I got up.  The weather turned out to be the best of the race meeting, it was still very cold, but the wind was not as strong and there was never enough rain to bother with a rain coat.

The morning warm ups and MotoGP qualifying went off with no problems, well certainly none at our point anyway.  The riders parade was cancelled, I think it was deemed to be too cold, but we got to see some GP greats instead.  The marshals were allowed trackside this year, so I was able to get some video footage of them.

The racing, bloody fantastic.  The Moto3 race was mayhem all race long, with Lorenzo Della Porta winning the race and the championship – certainly a worthy champion.  The Moto 2 race did not have the cut and thrust duelling at the front, but there were good battles further back.  Brad Binder showed he deserves a ride in MotoGP with a strong win, and it was good to see my favourite, Jorge Martin, finish on the podium for the second race in a row – a win is not far off for Jorge I am sure.  The MotoGP race – wow, Marc Marquez is a robot, he was relentless, rarely in the lead until it mattered.  I felt sorry for Vinales, he was the quickest man all weekend, but just could not break away from Marquez.  And the bonus, Jack Miller on the podium, what an awesome result.

Well it happened again,  I really have no idea what happened to Sunday, one minute I am getting out to point and the next, I am back in the muster shed having a few beers, until they ran out.  I once more caught the last bus back to camp,  where I ended up having a few red wines around a camp fire with Cliff and his wife.  I have worked on point with Cliff, his son and his daughter over the years, another friend I see twice a year.

Monday, wouldn’t you know it, a beautiful day that could have come a day earlier, but I suppose everyone got to pack up dry tents and did not have to ride home in rain.  I did sleep in a bit, but still managed to get away from camp at 7:30.  My first stop was Wonthaggi for breakfast and fuel for the van.  I had a comfort stop at Mirboo North (I have only mentioned that because I love the town names in this part of Victoria), and then stopped for lunch in Bairnsdale.

I arrived in Lakes Entrance about 1pm and quickly found a caravan park and ended up with  a beaut spot overlooking a lake, and it wasn’t expensive which is a bonus in a tourist area.  I managed to get some washing done  and hung on the line, before going for a walk down town.  I made it over to the surf beach, but nobody was swimming – I’m not surprised, it is a tad cold. 

Once back at the car, I attempted to sort out the mess I had created over the past few days, eventually making things marginally better.  I got my washing off the line – everything was dry except my bamboo socks, but they probably won’t be dry until I get home next Monday, they are great to wear, but a pain to wash.

Dinner is over now and I am settling in for the night.  I could get used to this campervan caper.
