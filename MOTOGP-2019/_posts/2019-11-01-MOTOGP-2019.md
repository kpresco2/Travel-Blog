Well here I am at another race meeting, this time it is the final round of the Australian Superbike Championship at Eastern Creek.

After I left Jindabyne ( on a chilly 3Â°c day), I drove to Hilltop (near Mittagong) where I stayed overnight with my brother-in-law Mitchell.  We did a bit of chatting, went to dinner at the RSL,  and chatted some more.  Thanks for putting me up Mitch.

From Hilltop it was an easy drive to the circuit where I camped last night.

Today was all just free practice, so it wad a long day, but thankfully no serious accidents.  It does seems strange to be at a race meeting where it is not windy and cold.

Tomorrow is qualifying and some races.  It should be an exciting day.
