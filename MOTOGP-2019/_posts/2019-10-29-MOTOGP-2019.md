29 Oct 2019
I slept in a little bit this morning, and woke to another beautiful sunny day.  With breakfast over and the van reconfigured for daytime, I was on the road by 8am.  It was an easy drive, with not much traffic, but there were still a few bikes about.  I tried to be as little a hindrance as possible – I know what it is like getting stuck behind slow vehicles on this road.

At Cann River I stopped for a coffee and a very nice sausage roll.  I also topped up with petrol as it was “relatively” cheap and I know fuel can be expensive at Bombala.

Poor old Jucy struggled up some of hills today, and she was smelling a bit hot when I stopped, but the temperature gauge didn’t indicate any problems.

On the road from Bombala to Jindabyne, I caught sight of snow still on the peaks of the Snowy Mountains, a  very pretty sight.

Once in Jindabyne, I quickly found the lakeside caravan park that Judith and I had used previously.  The unpowered sites are located along the lakeshore which is great,  and the amenities are new and clean.  It is run by NRMA, so I got a discount for being an RACQ member, which was a bonus.

I spent a bit of time on chores, then went for a walk and miraculously found a brewery, well Google maps may have alerted me to its existence.  What could I do, other than sample their product?  So I had a nice  Kosciuszko Pale Ale, sitting with a view of Lake Jindabyne in glorious weather.  It does not get much better.

I walked back along the lake front and found a monument to Paul Strzelecki, a Polish explorer and scientist, who surveyed large areas of NSW, Victoria and Tasmania.  He also climbed and named Mt Kosciuszko.

Once back at camp, I finally figured out how to check the oil in Jucy, once I found out she is mid-engined.  You have to lift the passenger seat to get at the engine and transmission dipsticks.  The levels are OK, but I think she could use some fresh oil.

I am all set for a quiet evening, a few beers and a feed with water views.
