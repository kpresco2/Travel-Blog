Today I was at Start/Finish, which isn't as exotic as it sounds.  I was in the middle of a long straight, so not a real action point.  You do get to to see the start and end of races, and what happens in pit lane.  But I would prefer to be on a good corner, where you see dareing overtaking manoeuvres.  Maybe tomorrow.

Tonight at the officials BBQ,  a lot of top riders came over to talk to us, as well as some of the up and comers and of course the juniors.  As a special treat Josh Brookes was there.  Josh recently finished 2nd in the British Superbike Championship by the narrow margin of 5 points.
