Race Day, and what a great spot I got today, Turn 8.  I was able to see a lot more of the track which was just as well as the racing was fabulous.  

All the classes put on a great spectacle, but it was the Superbikes that stole the show.  With only 0.5 points separating Troy Herfoss and Mike Jones before the last race, you just knew it would be hard fought, and it was, with the lead changing many of times (3 times on the final lap).  I got to see Herfoss's last ditch dive in turn 9 and it almost came off, but he ran wide and left Mike Jones to take the race and Championship.

Well that just about wraps up my mini adventure.  It has been great but I will glad to be back home tomorrow.
