Left home around 7am and stopped at Nambour for petrol (30c a litre cheaper than our local).  Struggled with traffic until the Beerwah turn-off, after that it was easy going to Esk.
 From Esk, I was almost on auto pilot, I have done this trip so often.

I stopped in Warwick for petrol and a bite to eat, before setting off for the NSW border.  Would I get stopped at the checkpoint? I had no idea.
